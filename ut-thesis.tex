%%  Skeleton LaTeX2e file for the preparation of theses at UofT;
%%  conforms to the School of Graduate Studies' guidelines of 07/97.
%%  To be used in conjunction with class file `ut-thesis.cls', whose
%%  features it illustrates.
%%
%%  To comment out parts of a file, use the macro \ignore{...}
%%  around the entire block of text you want to ignore.
%%
%%  To explicitly set the pagestyle of any inserted blank page when
%%  \cleardoublepage occurs, use one of \clearemptydoublepage or
%%  \clearplaindoublepage instead.
%%
%%  For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%%  `longquotation' environments.  For single-spaced, 1 1/2-spaced,
%%  or double-spaced paragraphs, use one of the environments
%%  `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.  More
%%  generally, for paragraphs with a line spacing of `n', use
%%  `\begin{newspacing}{n}...\end{newspacing}'.
%%
%%  All other environments, commands, and options provided by the

%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (10pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, normal margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.

%% ***   Add any desired options.   ***
%\documentclass[draft]{ut-thesis}
\documentclass{ut-thesis}


%% ***   Add \usepackage declarations here.   ***
\usepackage{setspace}
%\singlespacing
\onehalfspacing
%\doublespacing


\input{macros/packages.tex}

\input{macros/symbols.tex}


%% The line spacing of the document should be specified using one of
%% the document options given above, but if you need a line spacing
%% that is not provided by the options, you can override the default
%% line spacing for the entire document with the command
%%   `\linespacing{...}'.
%% Note that in order to get the correct appearance, the argument to
%% `\linespacing' must be equal to 1/3 + 2/3 times the desired line
%% spacing (for example, single-spaced = \linespacing{1},
%%                        1 1/2-spaced = \linespacing{1.33}, and
%%                       double-spaced = \linespacing{1.66}).

%% ***   Uncomment and fill in a value, if needed.    ***
%% ***   REMEMBER: You should NOT need to use this.  Use one of   ***
%% ***   the document class options mentionned above instead.     ***

%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%% ***   NOTE   ***
%% You should put all of your `\newcommand', `\newenvironment', and
%% `\newtheorem's (in other words, all the global definitions that
%% you will need throughout your thesis) in a separate file and use
%% "\input{filename}" to input it here.

\input{macros/definitions}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage
%% and the table of contents starts with \clearpage.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
\begin{dedication}
	\vspace{12ex}
	\begin{quotation}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{em}
				\section*{Dedication}
				Dedicated to the memory of Avner Magen
    		\end{em}
		\end{center}
	\end{quotation}
\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% you should put an explicit \newpage between them.

\newpage
%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
\begin{acknowledgements}
\input{acknowledgements}
\end{acknowledgements}

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
%\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
%\listoffigures

%% This generates the List of Algorithms (on a separate page), if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
%\listofalgorithms


%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep   %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files    %%
%%  right here.  Note that each chapter file should start with the  %%
%%  line "\chapter{ChapterName}".  Note that using `\include'       %%
%%  instead of `\input' makes each chapter start on a new page.     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% ***   Include chapter files here.   ***
\include{Chapter1} % Introduction
\include{Chapter2} % Randomized Linear Algebraic Primitives
\include{Chapter3} % Linear Regression - Matrix Algorithms
\include{Chapter4} % Graph Algorithms
\include{Chapter5} % Conclusions
\include{Appendix} % Appendix (placeholder for proof)

%% This adds a line for the Bibliography in the Table of Contents.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
%% ***   Set the bibliography style.   ***
%% (change according to your preference)
{\small
\bibliographystyle{alpha}
%% ***   Set the bibliography file.   ***
%% ("thesis.bib" by default; change if needed)
\bibliography{references}
}
%% ***   NOTE   ***
%% If you don't use bibliography files, comment out the previous line
%% and use \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.  (In that
%% case, you should probably put the bibliography in a separate file
%% and `\include' or `\input' it here).
